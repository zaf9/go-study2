# Tasks: Dashboard 首页功能

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/015-dashboard-homepage/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per the constitution, features MUST have at least 80% unit test coverage. Test tasks are **MANDATORY**.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/`, `frontend/`
- Frontend paths: `frontend/app/`, `frontend/components/`, `frontend/lib/`
- Backend paths: `backend/internal/`, `backend/api/`

## Constitution Guardrails

- 所有注释与用户文档相关任务必须产出中文内容,且保持清晰一致(Principle V/XV)。
- 需规划达到>=80%测试覆盖,各包包含 *_test.go 与示例,前端核心组件同样达标(Principle III/XXI/XXXVI)。
- 目录/文件/函数保持单一职责与可预测结构,遵循标准 Go 布局(仅根目录 main, go.mod/go.sum 完整)并补齐包 README(Principle IV/VIII/XVIII/XIX)。
- 外部依赖与复杂度最小化,错误处理显式,避免 YAGNI(Principle II/VI/IX)。
- 完成后需包含更新 README 等文档的任务(Principle XI)。

- [X] T012 Implement WebSocket events definition in backend/internal/websocket/events.go (defines progress_updated and quiz_completed event structures, see contracts/websocket-events.md)
- [X] T013 Add WebSocket route in backend/api/v1/websocket.go (handles WebSocket upgrade, authentication verification, client registration)
- [X] T014 [P] Implement WebSocket Provider in frontend/components/providers/WebSocketProvider.tsx
- [X] T015 [P] Add TypeScript types for Dashboard data in frontend/types/dashboard.ts

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - 主题进度可视化 (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: 在首页看到各主题的学习进度（列出所有可学习的主题，每个主题显示其完成百分比，使用进度条可视化展示完成度）

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 stories first: US1, US2, US5, then P2: US3, then P3: US4)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May display data from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Completely independent
- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Partially completed in Foundational (Phase 2) - Just needs verification

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Backend service methods before controller methods
- Backend routes after controller methods
- Frontend components before page integration
- Core implementation before WebSocket event handling
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002-T009)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T014-T018 can run in parallel (frontend), T010-T013 can run in parallel (backend)
- **User Story Tests**: All test tasks within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- **User Story Implementation**: 
  - US1: T025-T028 can run in parallel (different files)
  - US2: T037-T038, T040-T041 can run in parallel
  - US3: T046-T047 can run in parallel
  - US4: T053-T054 can run in parallel
- **Different User Stories**: Can be worked on in parallel by different team members after Foundational phase

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T021: "Unit test for WelcomeHeader component in frontend/__tests__/dashboard/WelcomeHeader.test.tsx"
Task T022: "Unit test for StatsCards component in frontend/__tests__/dashboard/StatsCards.test.tsx"
Task T023: "Backend unit test for学习天数计算 in backend/tests/service/progress_service_test.go"
Task T024: "Backend integration test for Dashboard stats API in backend/tests/controller/progress_controller_test.go"

# Launch all parallel implementation tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task T025: "Implement学习天数计算逻辑 in backend/internal/service/progress_service.go"
Task T026: "Implement Dashboard stats calculation in backend/internal/service/progress_service.go"
Task T027: "Create WelcomeHeader component in frontend/app/(protected)/dashboard/components/WelcomeHeader.tsx"
Task T028: "Create StatsCards component in frontend/app/(protected)/dashboard/components/StatsCards.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 5 Only - All P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (学习状态快速概览)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (一键继续学习)
5. Complete Phase 7: User Story 5 (路由与导航调整)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
7. Deploy/demo MVP

**MVP Scope**: 80 tasks (T001-T063, T064-T080 optional)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready (T001-T020)
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP Core!) (T021-T033)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (T034-T043)
4. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (T060-T063)
5. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (T044-T050)
6. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (T051-T059)
7. Polish & Optimize → Final release (T064-T080)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T020)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T021-T033)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T034-T043)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (T044-T050)
   - **Developer D**: User Story 4 (T051-T059)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team completes Polish together (T064-T080)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All Chinese comments and documentation per constitution
- Maintain ≥80% test coverage per constitution
