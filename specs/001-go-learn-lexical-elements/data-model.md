# Data Model for Go Lexical Elements Learning Tool

## Overview

This feature is primarily focused on demonstrating Go's lexical elements through a command-line interface. It does not involve persistent data storage, user accounts, or complex domain entities.

The "data" in this context is the static content of the Go language specification, which will be embedded within the source code as comments and examples.

## Entities

No persistent data entities are required for this feature.
